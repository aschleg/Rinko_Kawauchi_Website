            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Rinko Kawauchi was born in Shiga, Japan in 1972. She graduated from Seian University of Art and Design in 1993 and began a career as a freelance photographer in 1997. Before becoming a fine art photographer, Rinko Kawauchi worked in the advertising industry. IN 2001, she received international recoginition with the release of three photobooks, <em>Utatane, Hanako and Hanabi</em>. Since then, she has released several other books as well as had numerous solo and group exhibitions throughout the world. Her camera of choice is a Rolleiflex and also a Canon 5D. In her work, Rinko Kawauchi is looking for something that can affect our subconsscious, by revealing the evidence of life in cycles through masterful editing of the small, fleeting moments that we don't pay much attention to, yet sum to be a large part of our lifes. She seeks simplicity in her work, believing that adding too much takes away from the main message. Her photographs also exhibit a sense of the absence of time, everything appears so still and peaceful. She feels time is not important, it is simply a man-made concept to give our lives a sense of structure and has no real meaning in the universe.</p>
