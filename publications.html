              <h2>Illuminance</h2>
              <p>Released in 2011, Illuminance was Rinko Kawauchi's first photobook to be published outside of Japan. The book contains 144 full-color photographs in 163 pages and is a collection of 15 years of work. Rinko Kawauchi strives to show the cycle of life through masterful editing of fleeting, perhaps even mundane, moments of time.</p> 

              <p>She describes the series as her obsession itself, and how everyone has there own perceptions and reality. She pursues to present work that can absorb into our subconcious and does this in a unique way by 'connecting' images. This allows for a new perspective by creating a sequence of images, rather than each image working independently.</p> 

              <p>Rinko Kawauchi has stated by editing this way it, "differentiates between a photograph and an artwork. Seeing two images next to each other opens up the imagination and gives birth to something else. Flipping through the pages of the book, it can arouse feelings of excitement, sadness, or happiness - things that are hard [for me] to do with words." Released after the devastating earthquake and tsunami that struck the northern part of Japan in 2011, Rinko Kawauchi is still able to hold onto and invoke hope in herself and anyone else affected by tragedy.</p>

              <h2>Murmuration</h2>
              <p>Commissioned by Photoworks for the Brighton Photo Biennial 2010, Murmuration is a collection of Rinko Kawauchi's photographs taken in Brighton, UK. Tens of thousands of flocking starlings convene near Brighton Pier in the dusk of winter and create a swirling, black could known as a murmuration. Intrigued by this, Rinko Kawauchi continued the flock theme by composing photographs of groups of people in Brighton. The commission was Rinko Kawauchi's first in the UK.</p>

              <h2>Semear</h2>
              <p>Rinko Kawauchi's exploration of Japanese-Brazilian communities throughout Brazil are presented in this photobook. Invited by the Museu de Arte Moderna, Sao Paulo, Rinko Kawauchi studied the everyday live of the people and animals that inhabit the beautiful scenery of the country. Brazil is known for its extremes, the rich and the poor, the extravagant festivals that intermittingly permeate everyday life, as well as the number of cultures and peoples that call the country home. These extremes are shown in stunning, muted photographs that capture the infinite energies of Brazil.</p>

              <h2>AILA</h2>
              <p>Aila, from the Turkish word "aile" meaning "family", is a series capturing the cycle of life. The photographs are primarily of nature, showcases the comparatively short amount of time each creature has on the earth. Images of babies, salmon eggs and a fawn are contrasted with images of a slaughtered chicken over a chopping block and blood-soaked ropes that held animals down as they awaited their fate.</p>

              <h2>Cui Cui</h2>
              <p>The photographs in Cui Cui are snapshots in time of Rinko Kawauchi's family taken over a period of 13 years and were first exhibited as a slideshow. Rinko Kawauchi has perserved in time both ordinary and major events in her family. A birth of a child, death of a grandfather and New Year's Holidays are juxtaposed with images of comparatively banal things such as a pale pink balloon hovering over a hardwood floor and a photo taken in the passenger seat of a car as it was driving. The photographs invoke a feeling one only feels in their hometown after being away for an extended period of time, and remembering the events that brought you back there.</p>

              <h2>The Eyes, the Ears</h2>
              <p>Drawing from her own daily life, Rinko Kawauchi explores what we can perceive with our senses. By using a technique known as lens flare, Rinko Kawauchi's photographs create a soft, dreamlike effect around everyday things such as a moth and a child looking out the window. In one image, a simple deer appears majestic and mysterious, seemingly far away and impossible to reach.</p>

              <h2>Utatane</h2>
              <p>Utatane, meaning "siesta", explores the etheral, dreamlike states Rinko Kawauchi also conjured in <em>AILA</em>. The tone is generally muted and light, but however seems brooding and dark. Many of the images feature young children in various states facing away from the camera. One gazes upward to the sky, away from the camera, creating a vast, open space, one that can almost seem overwhelming. Another features a young man pressing against a bedsheet as if trying to espace. Unable to see his face, it stirs a feeling of anxiety as we cannot ascertain if he is playing a trick or is in trouble. The book was published along with Hanabi and Hanako in 2001 and was featured in the British Journal of Photography's list of <a href="http://www.bjp-online.com/british-journal-of-photography/report/1646009/top">top ten books of the decade.</a></p>

              <h2>Hanabi</h2>
              <p>This photobook was released with <em>Utatane</em> and <em>Hanako</em> in 2001. These three books brought Rinko Kawauchi to international prominence while she was still pursuing her commercial career in advertising. Hanabi, meaning "fireworks", is the theme explored in this volume. Rinko Kawauchi received the prestigious Kimura Ihei Award and Hanabi was included in "The Photobook: A History. Vol 2" by Martin Parr and Gerry Badger. Badger said of Rinko Kawauchi's work, "Just when it seems that everything has been photographed, in every possible way, along comes a photographer whose work is so original that the medium is renewed. Such a photographer is Rinko Kawauchi, who makes simple, lyrical pictures, so fresh and unusual they are difficult to describe or classify."</p>
